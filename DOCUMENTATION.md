# Lilly Technical Challenge Documentation Template

*This documentation template serves as a place for you to discuss how you approached this challenge, any issues you faced & how you overcame them, or any other points that you feel would be relevant for the interviewers to know. The text in italics is here to guide you - feel free to remove it once you fill out each section!*

***Not every section in this document is required. This is just a template to help get you started. Feel free to add or remove sections as you feel necessary.***

## Approach
*How did you approach this challenge? Did you work through the objectives in any particular order? If so, why? Did you utilize any external resources, such as tutorials, guides, or other materials?*

My approach to this task was to first implement the medicines table to show the names and prices of the medicines, this allowed me to view any changes that I made to the database more easily, which better informed my development of the delte, update and create functionality which I added shortly after.

## Objectives - Innovative Solutions
*For the challenge objectives, did you do anything in a particular way that you want to discuss? Is there anything you're particularly proud of that you want to highlight? Did you attempt some objectives multiple times, or go back and re-write particular sections of code? If so, why? Use this space to document any key points you'd like to tell us about.*

I am particularly proud of my implementation of the 'Medicine Tracker' table, as I think this effectivly shows the name and price of the medicines, as well as clearly showing if there were any errors with the data using both visual colouring of the table, and a tool tip on hover. It also allows for the user to very easily delete or edit all the medicines in the database.

## Problems Faced
*Use this space to document and discuss any issues you faced while undertaking this challenge and how you solved them. We recommend doing this proactively as you experience and resolve the issues - make sure you don't forget! (Screenshots are helpful, though not required)*.

The main challenge I found throughout the task was trying to think about and deal with the possible API responses, for example, dealing with names and prices as empty strings or null, but I also had to think about and deal with the situations where the name and price keys themself may be missing, and what to do in those situations.

## Evaluation
*How did you feel about the challenge overall? Did some parts go better than others? Did you run out of time? If you were to do this again, and were given more time, what would you do differently?*

I thought the challenge was very good overall, it had a good mix of both front-end and back-end development. I think that the task was well structured while having lots of creative freedom to focus on developing the functionality and style of the application in the way that I wanted to, which I really liked.

If i had more time, the first thing I would do would add an ID attribute and give each medicine a unique ID. This would prevent issues when creating, editing, and deleting medicines with the same name.
